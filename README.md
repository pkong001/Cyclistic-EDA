# Overview

## Background
* The Cyclistic is a fiction company launched in 2016, offering a bike-share solution. Since then, the business has grown and has over 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
* There are two types of Cyclistic users, those who purchase casual tickets and those who are annual memberships. The marketing team believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be the key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members by investigating their behavior.

## Problem
* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
* What is the most effective marketing strategy to convert Cyclistic's casual riders to annual memberships?

## Goal
* Identify differences in behavior between member and casual riders. How do we convert casual into member riders?

## Preparation (data source)
* The data has been downloaded from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html and stored on Google Drive.
* Cyclistic is a fiction company for study purposes; however, the data provided by the company is real and tangible.
* The data is provided by Cyclistic, the company which originated and generated the data, and since the data is for learning purposes, we assume that the data is credible, reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited, which it is.


# Result
## Key findings
* On average casual riders tend to have a longer time per ride than member riders (42 minutes on average for casual riders and 14 minutes on average for member riders).
* Casual riders have a higher number of rides on Saturday and Sunday, while member riders have a higher number of rides during weekdays
* Peak ride is between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM
* Docked bike are getting less popular while electric and classic bike are becoming more popular.
* Peak rides in a year were in the months of June, July, August, and September.

## Recommendation
* Offer monthly subscription with no yearly contract to attract more customers in June, July, August, and September. Or weekends membership to attract casual riders or other offerings that appeal to someone who will take a ride during the summer and weekends.
* Offer a discount for a long time per ride for member users, this may attract casual users who take a long time per ride.

## Limitation
These are the reports in which, for study purposes, some relevant and more comprehensive data might not be included to prevent overcomplicated.
